# Color Map

## Introduction

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a Very-long-baseline
interferometry (VLBI) experiment aiming at capture of the first
pictures of black holes.  While an image worth a thousand words, the
interpretation of an image is subjective.  The presentation of an
image can strongly affect how human eyes identify features.  This is
especially true for two-dimensional intensity maps, where the value of
each pixel is represented by a color.  A poorly chosen colormap
between values and colors can fool the human eyes to, e.g., pick out
non-existing features, or to hide important features.
