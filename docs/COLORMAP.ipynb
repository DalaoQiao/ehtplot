    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/)\n",
    "is a Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment aiming at\n",
    "capture of the first pictures of black holes.  While an image worth a\n",
    "thousand words, the interpretation of an image is subjective.  The\n",
    "presentation of an image can strongly affect how human eyes identify\n",
    "features.  This is especially true for two-dimensional intensity maps,\n",
    "where the value of each pixel is represented by a color.  A poorly\n",
    "chosen colormap between values and colors can fool the human eyes to,\n",
    "e.g., pick out non-existing features, or to hide important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to present the resulting images of the EHT as accurate as\n",
    "possible, we take into account how human eyes work and provide a few\n",
    "guidance on the colormap usages in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Without putting in too much details, a good colormap for scientific\n",
    "representation of a scalar image should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. give readers a correct sense on the scalar values (intensities) in\n",
    "   the image;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. not artificially show features that do not exist;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. not intentionally hide features that exist;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. be effective in communicating scientific messages;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. be device-independent.\n",

    "aspects of human vision.  Here, L\\* is the lightness; a\\* and b\\* are\n",

    "## Color Appearance Parameters\n",
    "\n",

    "  colorfulness and chroma are, roughly speaking, the extrinsic and\n",
    "  intrinsic difference between a color and grey of an object,\n",
    "  respectively.  Saturation is the colorfulness of a color relative to\n",
    "  its own brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue): \"the degree to which a\n",
    "  stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the above terms can be defined very\n",

    "\n",
    "- *hue can encode an additional physical quantity* in an image (when\n",
    "  used in this way, the change of hue should be linearly proportional\n",
    "  to the quantity);\n",
    "\n",
    "- *hue is also ideal in making an image more attractive* without\n",
    "  interferencing the representation of pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dimension chroma is less recognizable and should not be used\n",
    "to encode physical information.  Since sRGB is only a subset of the\n",
    "Lab colorspace, there are human regonizable color that are not\n",
