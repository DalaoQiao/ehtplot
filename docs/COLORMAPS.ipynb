    "The [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) is a Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment aiming at capture of the first pictures of black holes.  While an image worth a thousand words, the interpretation of an image is subjective.  The presentation of an image can strongly affect how human eyes identify features.  This is especially true for two-dimensional intensity maps, where the value of each pixel is represented by a color.  A poorly chosen colormap between values and colors can fool the human eyes to, e.g., pick out non-existing features, or to hide important features.\n",

In order to describe device-independent color, companies create \"standardized\" [color spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space) such as [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) (standard RGB by HP and Microsoft) and [Adobe RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space).

Here, L\\* is the lightness; a\\* and b\\* are the green-red and blue-yellow color components.  The [CIECAM02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02) [color appearance model (CAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_appearance_model) published by the CIE in 2002 defines six color appearances: brightness Q, lightness J, colorfulness M, chroma C, saturation s, and hue h.

The lightness coordinates L\\* and J\\* are identical to Lab and Jab.  The chroma (relative saturation) C\\* and hue h (in degree hÂ°) are simply `C* = sqrt(a*^2 + b*^2)` and `h = atan2(b*, a*)` according to Redness-Greenness a and Yellowness-Blueness b in their own coordinates."
