    """The class for hierarchically organize subplots in ehtplot

    The Panel class is the "organization class" that allows ehtplot to
    hierarchically organize subplots and manage subplot properties.
    In each ehtplot Figure, there is always one root Panel instance.
    The root Panel can directly contain a single matplotlib axes or a
    set of subpanels.
